Day 1
Made basic login functionality
Working on supabase functionality
Done with basic supabase(user can login, sign up) and added some css
Added unfunctional dashboard

Day 2
Will do document uploading and AI topic extraction + convert to raw text. Some of this may carry over to the next day
I will be uploading my changes that 
1. convert it to raw text(supported for .docx, .pdf, and .txt)
2. extract its topic using openAI api key
3. store it in supabase table
This will be the second most important part of the project(I think)

Done uploading step 1(convert it to raw text)
Will work on step 2(extract its topic using openAI api key)

AHHHHHH finally got that all wrapped up its done!!!!

What to do in day 3: 
Chat section(Where you can actually learn some stuff)
Topics section - just add on, where you can see all your topics
Sources section - Add new sources for the ai to use

I think day 4 will be the settings page and some restyling, and day 5 will be deploying(on render, ofcourse!!!) after some final code checks and will make presentation

Day 3:
Starting to work on the topics page
Finally done with topics page - it took a bit more time than expected... will start new chat page(THE main thing)

Done with chat page - just need to add the context... more supabase tables.... I will upload my code after this is done! attaching SQL for message table right now
Damn i thot that would be done in 40 minutes..... looks like it was actually 2 hours.... I need to work on some web scraping for search the web now...😁
