Day 1
Made basic login functionality
Working on supabase functionality
Done with basic supabase(user can login, sign up) and added some css
Added unfunctional dashboard

Day 2
Will do document uploading and AI topic extraction + convert to raw text. Some of this may carry over to the next day
I will be uploading my changes that 
1. convert it to raw text(supported for .docx, .pdf, and .txt)
2. extract its topic using openAI api key
3. store it in supabase table
This will be the second most important part of the project(I think)
